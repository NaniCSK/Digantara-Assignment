# Satellite Tracker

## Overview
This project tracks the positions of satellites using TLE data and converts the coordinates from ECEF to latitude, longitude, and altitude. It also filters satellite positions based on user-defined regions and optimizes the process using distributed computing.

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Contains TLE data files.
- `src/`: Contains source code for various tasks.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages.

## Setup
1. Install the required libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the scripts in the following order:
    - `satellite_tracker.py`: Calculates satellite positions.
    - `ecef2lla.py`: Converts ECEF to latitude, longitude, and altitude.
    - `filter_region.py`: Filters the positions based on user-defined regions.
    - `optimize.py`: Optimizes the code for large datasets.

## Usage
```sh
python src/satellite_tracker.py
python src/ecef2lla.py
python src/filter_region.py
python src/optimize.py


i have only written the code for 30 satellites and input file as 30stas.txt, change input in file "satellite_tracker.py" to 3000sats.txt to run code for 3000 satillites.
